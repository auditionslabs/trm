          Doctor Strange director and co-writer Scott Derrickson had plans for a 
          sequel by October 2016. He signed to return as director in December

          announced in July 2019 along with Olsen's involvement, while Jade
          Halley Bartlett was hired to write the film that October. Derrickson
          stepped down as director in January 2020
